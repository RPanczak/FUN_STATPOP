Data are aggregated to hectare grid:  

> For the dissemination of data, statistical information on the population and households is analysed by using a hectare grid. For each hectare, the coordinates of the south-west corner (bottom left) are used as an identifier. Every characteristic or numeric value shown for each cell relates to occurrences within the 100x100 m surface of this cell, i.e. the number of  persons, for example, whose coordinates are found in the square in question. In this way they build an aggregation of the individual records from a survey that are allocated to each grid cell or hectare.

Clustering small values to ensure data protection:  


> For reasons of data protection, certain restrictions apply to variables from the population and household survey with regard to forwarding raw data and cartographic representations based on a measurement in hectares. To ensure data protection, absolute values from 1 to 3 are shown in standard tables as a group or cluster with the value of "3". Where their use can be justified, data that have not been grouped together in this way can be used for statistical, research and planning purposes after conclusion of a data protection agreement.
